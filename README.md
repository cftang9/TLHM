# Taylor’s law of fluctuation scaling for semivariances and higher moments of heavy-tailed data

This repository contains R programs for the article, “Taylor’s law of fluctuation scaling for semivariances and higher moments of heavy-tailed data.” 
This article has been submitted for publication. 

Prior to using R programs on this repository, please download the main R program [TL_Library.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cftang9/TLHM/main/TL_Library.R?token=AK5HQA6Q4B5CG23Z6JUG5FLBOBB3I). Two R packages, ```stabledist``` and ```xtable```, are used to generate random sample from one-sided stable law F(c,&alpha;), c>0, 0<&alpha;<1, and organizing simulation results, respectively.  

## Part 1. Tail-index estimator comparison. 
Here we generate random samples from F(1,&alpha;) and evaluate the performance of the proposed tail-index estimators of &alpha; with the bias (x 10^3; average of estimate minus true &alpha;) and the mean squared error (mean squared \[estiamte minus true &alpha;\]).

## Part 2. Convergence of the number of observations exceeding the sample mean

### 2.1. Figures 1 and 2 in the manuscript.

## Part 3. More of convergence speeds of the generalized Taylor's law and the number of observations exceeding the sample mean.
